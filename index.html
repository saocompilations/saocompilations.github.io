	<h2>Welcome to the Sword Art Online Collated Side Stories website!</h2>
	<p>Hey! kazakhstanipotassium here.<br> <br>
	On this website, you will find a compilation of every SAO fan translated side story set in the Aincrad arc, arranged in chronological order. You can download the PDF or EPUB files in the [DOWNLOADS] section. [READ ONLINE] section should not be used as it is excessively memory intensive, I am working on a way to fix it but don't expect it to work properly anytime soon! <br> <br> 
	I started this project mainly as a way to use up the abundance of spare time I found myself with, but it took much longer than I anticipated! The finished compilation contains over 500 pages' worth of material, which is a staggering amount of content that simply hasn't made it into the official light novels. I also started this project out of frustration that most SAO fan translated content is currently spread out across multiple different sites, with navigating between them (even with the help of guides such as the brilliant <a href="https://cirtoyt.com" target="_blank">cirtoyt.com</a>) being tedious and time-consuming. So, I decided to collect all the side story translations I could find, and compile them into a single document such that they are easily accessible. <br> <br>
I must here make a <i>very</i> important disclaimer: <b>I DID NOT MAKE PLAY A PART IN TRANSLATING ANY STORY YOU FIND HERE, AND AS SUCH DO NOT CLAIM OWNERSHIP OVER ANY OF THEM!</b> <br> All of the content I have compiled is the work of other people, and if you are one of the people with ownership rights over content I have included and you do not want it to be included here, <b>please contact me at kazakhstanipotassium@gmail.com!</b> I'll make sure to remove it from the compilation. <br> <br>
	Actually, I <i>can</i> claim ownership over a single part of the compilation: the (admittedly rather mediocre) cover image. I figured I should try to produce at least <i>some</i> content instead of my own, so I settled on attempting to create some original cover art. After numerous hours, and numerous crashes (my hatred for Adobe knows no bounds), I was left with a quite basic image, but after my project's .PSD file corrupted the third time around and I once again lost half my data, I decided to just give up and move forward with what I had. Hence, the rather rough-around-the-edges look. In any case, however, my lack of artistic skill would have prevented me from creating anything nearly as beautiful as the artwork that abec creates to accompany Kawahara's official light novels; he (or she?) has my utmost respect. <br>

	<h2>Credits</h2>
	<p>Listed below are all the websites I have sourced translations from; credits to individual translators can be found within the compilation itself, under the title of each side story.<br> <br>
	<i style="color: grey;">As of 22/03/2025, dreadfuldecoding.blogspot.com is down, so please use the Internet Archive Wayback Machine to access it. <br> <br>
	I'm not really sure of the legality of some of the bato.to links, so if it turns out I'm accidentally breaking copyright law, tell me! They were on cirtoyt.com (which is linked to by the r/swordartonline subreddit) so i'm assuming they aren't pirated and I've used them in my compilation.</i></p>
